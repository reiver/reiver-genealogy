§ Sayyid Hassan Safavi

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Sayyid Hassan Safavi** (1934 - March 11, 2004) is my uncle and my mother's (i.e., **Malekeh Agha Safavi**'s) oldest brother.

His father's name is **Sayyid Ali Safavi**.
And his mother's name is **Robabeh Sultan Ahan**.

He has 6 siblins —

• **Begum Agha Safavi**
• **Soghra Bagum Safavi**
• **Ashraf Al-Sadat Safavi**
• **Sayyid Hussein Safavi**
• **Sayyid Mehdi Safavi**
• **Malekeh Agha Safavi**

He married **Ashraf Akbari**, and had 2 children, both sons —

• **Sayyid Ali Safavi**
• **Sayyid Abbas Safavi**

❦

**Sayyid Hassan Safavi** was my mother's (i.e., **Malekeh Agha Safavi**'s) guardian for much of her youth.

❦

I called him: **Dāyee Hassan**.

(Which basically means “//Uncle Hassan//” in the [[persian-language]].
Although “Dayee” means “//maternal uncle//”.
There's a different word for “//paternal uncle//” — “//amu//”.
So "//dāyee//" conveys a little more information than the English word "uncle".)

My brother's first-name — **Hassan Robert Krempeaux**'s first-name — (i.e., “//Hassan//”) is named after **Sayyid Hassan Safavi**.
According to my mother, it was my father's idea — i.e., it was **Charles Robert Krempeaux**'s idea — to give my brother my **Dāyee Hassan**'s name.
