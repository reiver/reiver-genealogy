§ Charlotte Elizabeth Krempowiecki

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Charlotte Elizabeth Krempowiecki** (~1847 - August 14th, 1958) is **my great-aunt** and my father's father's (i.e., **Charles Stanislaus Krempeaux**'s) sister.

In some records her family-name is shortened as //Krempo// — and thus her name also sometimes appears as **Charlotte Elizabeth Krempo** and **Charlotte Krempo**.

Her father's name is **Alfred Thadias Krempowiecki**.
Although I have also seen “Thadias” spelled as “Thadeus”.
And sometimes the first-name (“Alfred”) isn't included.

Her mother's name is **Martha**.
**Martha**'s middle-name or family-name may have been //Jane//.

She has 2 siblings; a sister and a brother.
Her sister's name is: **Violet Krempowiecki**.
And her brother's name is: **Charles Stanislaus Krempeaux** — who would have assumingly been born **Charles Stanislaus Krempowiecki**, and also sometimes had his name shortened as **Charles Stanislaus Krempo** and **Charles Krempo**.
