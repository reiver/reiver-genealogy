⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Audrey Jane Krempeaux** (August 30, 1928 - June 18, 1998) is **my aunt** and my father's (i.e., **Charles Robert Krempeaux**'s) younger sister.

Her father's name is **Charles Stanislaus Krempeaux**.
And her mother's name is **Helen Elizabeth Kerr**.

She is the youngest of 3 children.
And thus has 2 siblings; both siblings being brothers.
Her oldest brother's name is named **Paul Douglas Krempeaux**.
Her 2nd oldest brother (and my father) is named **Charles Robert Krempeaux**.

She married **William Charles Tindol III** and had 2 children with him —

• **Mark Robert Tindol**, and
• **William Scott Tindol**.

And she had 2 nephews, via her brother **Charles Robert Krempeaux** —

• **Charles Iliya Krempeaux** (i.e., me), and
• **Hassan Robert Krempeaux**.

She is the aunt I saw most of my life.
(Living in [[metro-vancouver]] most of my life, I only saw my mother's sisters when I was very young, since they lived in [[iran]].)

I called her **Auntie Audrey**.
