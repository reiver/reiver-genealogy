§ Hussein Ali Ahan

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Hussein Ali Ahan** is **my great grandfather** -- my mother's (i.e., **Malekeh Agha Safavi**'s) mother's (i.e., **Robabeh Sultan Ahan**) father.

I don't (yet) know the names of his parents.

I don't know if he had any brothers or sisters.

**Hussein Ali Ahan** married **Javaher Sultan Asami**.
(**Note** that I am not sure that **Javaher Sultan**'s family name was actually see "Asami".)

They had 3 children....

• **Robabeh Sultan Ahan** (i.e., my maternal grandmother),
• **Mohammad Ali Ahan**,
• **Khadijeh Sultan Ahan**.

I never met him, but my mother (**Malekeh Agha Safavi**) remembers him.

§§ Stories

I've heard things about **Hussein Ali Ahan** over the years, from my mother.

She said that he lived to a very very old age.
I am not sure of his exact age when he died, but my mother said he was over 100 years old.
He lived way way longer than his wife.
And lived longer than at least one of his children.

My mother also said that he was very very tall.
Taller than everyone else (that they knew).
So my guess would be that he was approaching 7" tall.

My mom also said that he was very very strong.
That he would rip apart Bronze plates with his bare hands!, to show how strong he was.
And that he would rip apart phones books, with his bare hands too, to show how strong he was.

My guess is that his genes probably have something to do with my mother / his grandaughter -- Malekeh Agha Safavi -- being such an amazing athlete and competing in the Olympics.

Also, my guess is that his genes probably also have something to do with my brother and I both being "super athletes" growing up and both being naturally very very muscular. I believe the word to describe our body types is Mesomorphs.
